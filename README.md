# Explanations of the technologies used
- Devise authentication
- Ruby on Rails

# A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took

- Initial start was doing prework and conceptualising application
- After which came the selection of which technologies and frameworks to use, ultimately decided on ruby on rails

# Installation instructions for any dependencies
- bundle install
- rails db:reset
- Can be used without user account, but sign up with user account and selected estate will allow for adding of cats and updating of feed times
- Test account credentials:
	- usera@gmail.com / userb@gmail.com / userc@gmail.com 
	- Password for all accounts is ***password***
# Link to your user stories â€“ who are your users, what do they want, and why?
-   I am a stray cat feeder that wants to ensure that all cats are appropriately fed
-   I am a stray cat feeder who wants to coordinate with other feeders on the feeding of cats
-   I am a cat welfare volunteer that wants to have data on the number of cats living in my area

# Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome
- Tried to use React Frameworks such as OnsenUI and Framework7 but unable to grasp the implementations within project timeframe
- Initial data model was scaled down from original design for ease of development
- Deciding on which technologies to use was challenging as each had its own merits and challenges
