### Approach and Process

__What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?__
* I got stuck on choosing which technologies to use for this project due to the openness of the requirements

__What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?__
* Don't feel like I did a lot of things well for this project, so rather not repeat it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Code and Code Design

__What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?__
* Relied too much on generate scaffold to the point of confusion on what is what
* Lack of commenting, which is really a bad habit I need to kick when doing professionally
* Use of a lot of side sandbox projects in fear of messing up the main project, as such no proper log of commits

__What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?__
* Tried mobile first designing, but ended up the desktop version looking like crap, will need to learn more on getting the best of both worlds

### SEI Unit 4 Post Mortem

__What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?__
* All habits of mine were detrimental :(

__What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?__
* Setting personal goals for myself, I feel that as the only stakeholder in this project, I am less motivated to do it as compared to when doing it for work or in a group.
* As such I need to train reframe my way of thinking about goals

__How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)__
* React flew by very fast and I only got a tiny gist of it, will need to continue to learn about after the course.
* Overall the material was ok in helping me get the basics down
